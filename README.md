Hello, I'm Damon!  I am a full-stack web developer who enjoys problem solving.  I went through Lambda School's intense full-stack web development course to learn how to code.  Now I am balancing looking for a position at a company with an enthusiastic team and continuing to learn and upgrade my skills.
